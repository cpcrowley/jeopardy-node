to avoid scraping the j-archive site again, let's do 2, that is, re-scrape from the HTML files in html/. that is why i kept the html files.
can you write a script that will re-scrape from the html/ files instead of j-archive site?

I ran rescrape-from-html.js, then classify-games.js, then analyze-seasons.js.
This fixed the 0.0 double jeopardy score issue.
For seasons 14-36 the double jeopardy scores were all around 25.
But for season 37 is is lower (15.8), for season 38 is is very low (0.3), for season 39 and 40 it is 0.0.
Then for season 41 it is back up to 19.
I assume the problem is some format change in those seasons.
Can you figure out what is going wrong here?

please move the three node js scripts into a scripts/ directory.
